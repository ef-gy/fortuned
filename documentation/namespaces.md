#<cldoc:fortuned>

Base namespace

This is the base namespace for all the headers contained within fortuned.
This namespace is used to prevent namespace clashes with your own code - if
you don't want to use fully qualified names in your code, use the 'using'
directive after including the headers, like so:

    using namespace fortuned;
